Approaches to Study Neural Circuits

The class is now finished. All 11 lectures are recorded and available 
to watch. All course materials, including assigned readings and 
lecture slides, are under the "code" tab, or in the "View code" folder
if you're on a mobile device.

We have done our best to ensure all of the course material is accurate,
but any necessary corrections will be in each lecture folder. If there
are any questions or problems, or if you note any inaccuracies or 
important omissions, email luke@sjulsonlab.org
